# Common Workflows

## Research to Podcast (Interactive)
**Time:** 5-10 minutes total

1. `notebooklm create "Research: [topic]"` — *if fails: check auth with `notebooklm login`*
2. `notebooklm source add` for each URL/document — *if one fails: log warning, continue with others*
3. Wait for sources: `notebooklm source list --json` until all status=READY — *required before generation*
4. `notebooklm generate audio "Focus on [specific angle]"` (confirm when asked) — *if rate limited: wait 5 min, retry once*
5. Note the artifact ID returned
6. Check `notebooklm artifact list` later for status
7. `notebooklm download audio ./podcast.mp3` when complete (confirm when asked)

## Research to Podcast (Automated with Subagent)
**Time:** 5-10 minutes, but continues in background

When user wants full automation (generate and download when ready):

1. Create notebook and add sources as usual
2. Wait for sources to be ready (use `source wait` or check `source list --json`)
3. Run `notebooklm generate audio "..." --json` → parse `artifact_id` from output
4. **Spawn a background agent** using Task tool:
   ```
   Task(
     prompt="Wait for artifact {artifact_id} in notebook {notebook_id} to complete, then download.
             Use: notebooklm artifact wait {artifact_id} -n {notebook_id} --timeout 600
             Then: notebooklm download audio ./podcast.mp3 -a {artifact_id} -n {notebook_id}",
     subagent_type="general-purpose"
   )
   ```
5. Main conversation continues while agent waits

**Error handling in subagent:**
- If `artifact wait` returns exit code 2 (timeout): Report timeout, suggest checking `artifact list`
- If download fails: Check if artifact status is COMPLETED first

**Benefits:** Non-blocking, user can do other work, automatic download on completion

## Document Analysis
**Time:** 1-2 minutes

1. `notebooklm create "Analysis: [project]"`
2. `notebooklm source add ./doc.pdf` (or URLs)
3. `notebooklm ask "Summarize the key points"`
4. `notebooklm ask "What are the main arguments?"`
5. Continue chatting as needed

## Bulk Import
**Time:** Varies by source count

1. `notebooklm create "Collection: [name]"`
2. Add multiple sources:
   ```bash
   notebooklm source add "https://url1.com"
   notebooklm source add "https://url2.com"
   notebooklm source add ./local-file.pdf
   ```
3. `notebooklm source list` to verify

**Source limits:** Max 50 sources per notebook  
**Supported types:** PDFs, YouTube URLs, web URLs, Google Docs, text files, Markdown, Word docs, audio files, video files, images

## Bulk Import with Source Waiting (Subagent Pattern)
**Time:** Varies by source count

When adding multiple sources and needing to wait for processing before chat/generation:

1. Add sources with `--json` to capture IDs:
   ```bash
   notebooklm source add "https://url1.com" --json  # → {"source_id": "abc..."}
   notebooklm source add "https://url2.com" --json  # → {"source_id": "def..."}
   ```
2. **Spawn a background agent** to wait for all sources:
   ```
   Task(
     prompt="Wait for sources {source_ids} in notebook {notebook_id} to be ready.
             For each: notebooklm source wait {id} -n {notebook_id} --timeout 120
             Report when all ready or if any fail.",
     subagent_type="general-purpose"
   )
   ```
3. Main conversation continues while agent waits
4. Once sources are ready, proceed with chat or generation

**Why wait for sources?** Sources must be indexed before chat or generation. Takes 10-60 seconds per source.

## Deep Web Research (Subagent Pattern)
**Time:** 2-5 minutes, runs in background

Deep research finds and analyzes web sources on a topic:

1. Create notebook: `notebooklm create "Research: [topic]"`
2. Start deep research (non-blocking):
   ```bash
   notebooklm source add-research "topic query" --mode deep --no-wait
   ```
3. **Spawn a background agent** to wait and import:
   ```
   Task(
     prompt="Wait for research in notebook {notebook_id} to complete and import sources.
             Use: notebooklm research wait -n {notebook_id} --import-all --timeout 300
             Report how many sources were imported.",
     subagent_type="general-purpose"
   )
   ```
4. Main conversation continues while agent waits
5. When agent completes, sources are imported automatically

**Alternative (blocking):** For simple cases, omit `--no-wait`:
```bash
notebooklm source add-research "topic" --mode deep --import-all
# Blocks for up to 5 minutes
```

**When to use each mode:**
- `--mode fast`: Specific topic, quick overview needed (5-10 sources, seconds)
- `--mode deep`: Broad topic, comprehensive analysis needed (20+ sources, 2-5 min)

**Research sources:**
- `--from web`: Search the web (default)
- `--from drive`: Search Google Drive
