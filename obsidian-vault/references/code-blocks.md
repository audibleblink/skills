# Code Blocks

## Inline Code

```md
Use `backticks` for inline code.
Use ``double backticks for ` inside``.
```

## Fenced Code Blocks

````md
```js
console.log("hello");
```
````

## Nested Code Blocks

Use more backticks (or tildes) for the outer block than the inner:

`````md
````md
```js
console.log("nested");
```
````
`````
